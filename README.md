_ZIPPERMAU5_ is my WIP micromouse robot!

This repository contains zippermau5's platformio project files and the zippermau5 website's source.

The current status of the project is that some basic mazesolving is working, the pcb is here and assembled, and I'm going to be working on getting the mouse to run!
